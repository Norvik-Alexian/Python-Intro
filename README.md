# Python-Intro

## Language Introduction
* Python is dynamic, interpreted (byte-code compiled) language.
* Python supports OOP, structured programming and other approaches.
* Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs.

## Running Python Code
* We can run Python code different ways (interpreted, console, IDE)
* An excellent way to see how Python code works is to run the Python interpreted and type code right into it.

## Python Interpreter Versions
There are 2 main versions of Python
* Python 2
* Python 3

## Python Identifiers
Identifier in Python is pseudonym for variable, function class, module or some other object.

## Python Operations
Python operations can be performed by:
* operators
* specific functions

## Python Data Typing
* Dynamic Typed (type of variable can change)
* Strongly Typed (value can be associated with one specific type)
* Implicitly Typed (type of variable shouldn't be declared explicitly)

## Python Console Input
* We can get data from user using input() function in Python 3
* input() function gets the content of a line as string
* input() wait until user writes something and pushes enter

## Python Indentation
* One unusual Python feature is that the whitespace indentation of a piece of code affects its meaning.
* According to the office Python style guide you should indent with 4 spaces.

## Module
* Module is file with Python code and .py extension
* Program can call other programs after importing them.
* When we import a module it's being executed
* Importing a module is one other way to execute it
* Import works once for each module, even if it was called several times.
* Module is used as a library
* Module is considered as set of variable names also called namespace
* Each variable name from namespace is called attribute
* Attribute is a variable related to some object like module.
* Modular structure with differentiated namespaces allows to avoid name conflicts and makes code more simple dividing 
complex construction into smaller chunks

## Python help() and dir()
* dir(module) get list of available names in module
* help(object) gets information from documentation about the object.

## Scripts
* Script vs Program: script is simple small program
* Python can be considered for both writing scripts or bigger programs.

## Python Keywords:
* Keywords - is a word that reserved by a program because the word has a special meaning
* Keywords can be commands or parameters.
* Every programming language has a set of keywords that cannot be used as variable names.
* Keywords are sometimes called reserved names.

## Simple Identifier Usage
Identifiers should be initialized before using, otherwise error will be generated, in expression identifier is replaced
by related value.

## Constants
* A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.
* Python doesn't support constants by default.
